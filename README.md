# Disease-Detection-with-CNN-and-Grad-CAM
This repository contains a complete deep learning-based web application for automatic skin disease detection and medical image classification using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Built with TensorFlow/Keras and Gradio, the app supports predictions for:

Skin diseases (based on the HAM10000 dataset)

Brain tumor detection (MRI classification into four categories)

Chest X-ray analysis (normal, viral, bacterial)

The web interface also includes:

Grad-CAM visual explanations for model predictions

Patient appointment booking system

Contact form for doctor communication

Informational tabs about diseases and the clinic staff

ðŸ”§ Features Custom CNN and MobileNet-based classifiers

Grad-CAM visualizations for interpretability

Appointment and messaging system with CSV logging

Multi-tab Gradio web interface with image examples

ðŸ“¦ Technologies Python, TensorFlow, Keras, Gradio, OpenCV, Pandas, Scikit-learn
